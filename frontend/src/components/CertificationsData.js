      "This course explores Generative AI using IBM Watsonx, teaching how to build, deploy, and fine-tune AI models for real-world applications. It covers natural language generation, AI-driven content creation, and integration with enterprise solutions. This course gave me a strong foundation in generative AI concepts and practical tools.<br><br>Some key things I learned along the way:<br>1. How generative AI works and where it fits in real-world applications<br>2. The capabilities of IBM watsonx.ai and how to build on top of it<br>3. Working with foundation models like FLAN-T5 for various tasks<br>4. Designing and developing end-to-end generative AI solutions<br>5. Implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance response quality<br>6. Creating AI-powered chatbots using IBM Watson tools and techniques<br><br>As part of the course, I also built a project called “Student Feedback Classifier” — a zero-shot classifier that uses a generative model to organize open-ended feedback into meaningful categories. A great hands-on experience to apply what I learned.",

      "This professional certificate covered the complete analytics workflow: asking the right business questions, gathering and cleaning data, exploratory analysis, visualization, and stakeholder communication. Projects emphasized reproducible analysis with spreadsheets and R, SQL joins and window functions, dashboards, and data storytelling. Assessment tasks reinforced practical skills and ethical data practices across multiple case studies, simulating realistic analyst responsibilities in collaborative environments.<br><br>This certification involved 8 in-depth courses, guiding me through the entire data analytics lifecycle:<br>1. Foundations: Data, Data, Everywhere<br>2. Ask Questions to Make Data-Driven Decisions<br>3. Prepare Data for Exploration<br>4. Process Data from Dirty to Clean<br>5. Analyze Data to Answer Questions<br>6. Share Data Through the Art of Visualization<br>7. Data Analysis with R Programming<br>8. Google Data Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study<br><br>During this journey, I gained hands-on experience with tools like SQL, Tableau, Spreadsheets, and R. More importantly, I learned how to think critically about data and make data-driven decisions—skills that are invaluable for solving real-world problems. This certification marks a significant leap forward in my career as I transition towards the AI and ML side of data analysis. I’m excited to continue building on this foundation and exploring new horizons in the field of data science.",

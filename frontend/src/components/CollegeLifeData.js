<p>August 13, 2023. I arrived at VIT Chennai with two bags, a restless mind, and a heart full of dreams—my biggest leap after years of being confined to online classes at home. That day, I carried one mantra with me: "Build yourself." Build a version of me that no challenge, no failure, and no noise could shake.</p>
<p>The campus felt like another world. New faces, new voices, a completely new culture—at first, it was overwhelming, like being dropped into the middle of a story already in progress. But slowly, the chaos turned into rhythm. Friendships formed, routines emerged, and opportunities started to reveal themselves in unexpected ways.</p>
<p>That flight wasn’t just a trip between cities—it was a leap into a new chapter. Since then, every day has been about adapting, learning, and reminding myself why I came: to grow, to create, and to keep moving forward.</p>

      "The first semester was a true test of courage. Coming from a small town, everything felt bigger, faster, and more polished than what I was used to. Starting a simple conversation seemed like a huge step, and fluent English speakers felt out of reach. But I kept trying, one small step at a time. The library became my sanctuary—my place to learn, grow, and gain confidence. I spent countless hours there until even the warden knew me by name. Those struggles became the foundation that made me stronger, more confident, and ready for the journey ahead.",

      "By the second semester, I was more at home on campus, but the competition grew sharper. Surrounded by talented peers, relative grading pushed me to stay consistent. My turning point came with the first serious coding course. What began as a subject quickly became a passion—logic and problem-solving started to excite me, and I found myself diving into web development on the side. This was the semester where curiosity transformed into direction, and my path toward becoming a developer started to take shape.",

      "The pace picked up dramatically in the third semester. With challenging subjects like Microprocessors, Java, DSA, and Computer Architecture, paired with a packed schedule of classes, labs, and club activities, every day tested my endurance. But programming remained my anchor—it gave me stability and confidence. This was also the semester of my first hackathon, where I experienced the thrill of competing and the joy of finishing as runners-up. That moment proved that perseverance and curiosity could open doors I never expected.",

      "The fourth semester tested me in ways I had never imagined. Chickenpox forced me into isolation room for 1 week, making me miss all midterm exams. What followed was a marathon of six re-exams in just two days—a physically and mentally draining experience. But I pushed through, proving to myself that I could handle pressure. Alongside this, I earned my Google Data Analytics Certification, adding depth to my skill set, and worked on impactful projects. This semester became a story of resilience, adaptability, and turning setbacks into stepping stones.",

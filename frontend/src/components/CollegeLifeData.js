<p>I came to VIT Chennai on 13th August 2023, with two bags, a restless mind, and a heart full of dreams—maybe the last big hope I had been holding on to. For two years, I had been studying online from home, staring at screens, locked in the same walls, and waiting for life to actually begin. The only thought running through my head that day was simple: “Build yourself” and that too in a way that no setback, no failure, and no noise could shake me again.</p>
<p>The new campus felt like a different world altogether. New faces, new voices, new culture—everything around me was unfamiliar. At first, it was confusing, as if I had been thrown into the middle of a story already in motion. But slowly, the chaos started shaping into something meaningful. Friendships formed, routines built, and opportunities opened up in ways I hadn't even imagined.</p>
<p>Looking back, that one flight wasn't just a journey from one city to another—it was a leap into a new chapter. Every day here has been about adapting, learning, and reminding myself why I came: to grow, to create, and to keep moving forward.</p>

      "The beginning of my first semester was marked by an overwhelming sense of inferiority, as I suddenly found myself in a completely new world. Coming from a small town in India, surrounded by simplicity and familiarity, stepping into a place where people spoke fluent English often made them feel like intimidating figures to me. At times, even initiating a simple conversation felt like a mountain to climb. Yet, slowly, I began to participate, however small the steps were, and with each effort, I started to feel more comfortable. The library became my second home, a quiet refuge where I could both learn and teach myself new concepts and skills. I spent countless hours there, until even the library warden knew me by name. By facing these struggles, I grew stronger, more confident, and ready for the journey ahead.",

      "This semester felt different. By now, I was comfortable with the campus, but this time my classes were filled with some really talented and high-scoring students. With relative grading in place, it became tougher to maintain my GPA, and I often felt like a 9-pointer on the edge. The turning point, however, was my first real coding subject. Until then, I only knew basic programming, but this course gave me the push to sharpen my logical thinking and problem-solving skills. It was here that I laid the foundation of my interest in coding, which later grew much stronger. Around the same time, I also began exploring web development, a side interest that slowly started turning into a passion and opened new possibilities for me.",

      "This one was a big jump in intensity. The number of subjects increased drastically, and for the first time, almost every slot in my timetable was packed with continuous classes and labs. On top of that, I had joined three clubs at the very beginning of the semester, which meant my schedule was always full. The subjects themselves were tougher—Microprocessors, Java, DSA, and Computer Architecture really tested me throughout the semester. Despite the heavy load, programming courses continued to be my anchor, and they once again helped me maintain a solid 9 GPA. This was also the semester where I experienced my first real hackathon as part of a team, and to my surprise, we came out as runner-up. Looking back, the challenges of this semester pushed me to become stronger, more resilient, and more confident in my technical abilities.",

Later, I faced the daunting task of taking all six re-exams in just two days—an intense and exhausting experience. Despite this, I stayed focused on my growth. I earned the Google Data Analytics Certification, strengthening my skills in data analysis, visualization, and problem-solving. I also worked on a couple of quality projects, applying my knowledge practically and enhancing my technical abilities. This semester taught me resilience, time management under pressure, and the importance of staying committed to goals, no matter the obstacles.",

<p>August 13, 2023 — the day I stepped into VIT Chennai with two bags, a restless mind, and a heart full of possibilities. After two years of studying within four walls at home, this felt like my first real step into the wider world. My mantra was clear: "Build yourself." Build a version of me that no challenge, failure, or distraction could shake.</p>
<p>The campus was alive with new faces, new voices, and new rhythms. At first, it felt like walking into the middle of a story already in progress, but slowly the pieces started to fit. Friendships formed, routines took shape, and opportunities opened up in directions I had never imagined.</p>
<p>That flight to Chennai wasn’t just about changing cities—it was the beginning of a new chapter. Every day since has been about growing, creating, and moving forward with purpose.</p>

I gravitated towards the library, where I found both quiet and curiosity. Those countless hours among books gave me direction and confidence. By the end of the semester, the nervous newcomer had turned into someone ready to take on the road ahead.",

Until then, programming was just a basic skill—I soon realized it could be a passion. Logic and problem-solving started to excite me, and web development became a side hobby that kept pulling me in. This semester was about discovery, laying the foundation for the coder I was becoming.",

It was exhausting, but it taught me the importance of staying calm under pressure. Alongside academics, I earned my Google Data Analytics Certification, adding a strong edge to my analytical skills. I also worked on meaningful projects, applying concepts to real-world problems. This semester shaped my ability to stay composed and deliver, no matter the circumstances.",

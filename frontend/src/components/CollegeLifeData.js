<p>August 13, 2023. I arrived at VIT Chennai with two bags, a restless mind, and a heart full of dreams—perhaps my last big hope. After two years of online learning from home, confined to the same four walls, I was finally stepping into real life. My mantra that day was simple yet powerful: "Build yourself." Build a version of me that no setback, failure, or noise could ever shake.</p>
<p>The campus felt like another world. New faces, new voices, an entirely new culture—everything was unfamiliar. At first, it was disorienting, like being dropped into the middle of a story already in progress. But gradually, the chaos began to form patterns. Friendships blossomed. Routines took shape. Opportunities emerged in ways I'd never imagined.</p>
<p>That flight wasn't just a journey between cities—it was a leap into a new chapter. Every day since has been about adapting, learning, and reminding myself why I came: to grow, to create, and to keep moving forward.</p>

      "My first semester began with overwhelming imposter syndrome. Coming from a small town, I found myself in a completely new world. Fluent English speakers seemed like intimidating figures. Starting a simple conversation felt like climbing a mountain. But I took small steps. I began participating, however timidly. With each effort, I grew more comfortable. The library became my sanctuary—a quiet place to learn and grow. I spent countless hours there until even the warden knew me by name. Through these struggles, I emerged stronger, more confident, and ready for the journey ahead.",

      "This semester felt different. I was comfortable with campus life, but now faced talented, high-achieving peers. With relative grading, maintaining my GPA became tougher—I felt like a 9-pointer on the edge. The turning point? My first real coding course. Before this, I only knew basic programming. This class sharpened my logical thinking and problem-solving skills. Here, I built the foundation of my coding passion. Around the same time, I began exploring web development—a side interest that slowly transformed into a passion, opening new possibilities.",

      "The intensity jumped dramatically. More subjects, packed timetables, continuous classes and labs. I joined three clubs, keeping my schedule constantly full. The subjects challenged me: Microprocessors, Java, DSA, and Computer Architecture tested my limits. Despite the load, programming courses remained my anchor, helping maintain a solid 9 GPA. This semester also brought my first hackathon experience. To my surprise, our team emerged as runners-up. These challenges forged me into a stronger, more resilient, and technically confident version of myself.",

Then came the daunting task: six re-exams in just two days—an intense, exhausting experience. Yet I stayed focused on growth. I earned my Google Data Analytics Certification, strengthening my skills in data analysis, visualization, and problem-solving. I also developed quality projects, applying knowledge practically. This semester taught me resilience, pressure management, and unwavering commitment to goals.",
